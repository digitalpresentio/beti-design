# DP FRONTEND TEST

For this test, you have two tasks.

1. Create the Category and Careers page of the website.
2. Test the breakpoints of the website and fix where needed.

Info about the project:

The project uses Bootstrap as a css framework.
The variables are overwritten with SASS.
If you need to create a new page, add it to the webpack config.
Before you start the project you have to install dependencies with Yarn or NPM (I, personally, use yarn).

To install dependencies:

```
    yarn
```

To start the development build:

```
    yarn start
```

To build the production site with css, js, minification etc.:

```
    yarn build
```

Cheers
